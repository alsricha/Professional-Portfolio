# Intention:

Re-created my professional portfolio to include links to github and linkedin websites as well as included a downloadable link to have my resume be downloaded. 

# Opportunities for Improvement

Still working out the kinks of the webpage. Color schemes still need to be updated as well as fix some of the transitions from section to section. I would like
to update the portfolio section photos and add additional context info for each project.
